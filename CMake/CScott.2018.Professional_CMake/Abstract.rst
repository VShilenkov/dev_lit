15.Language Requirements
************************

15.1. Setting The Language Standard Directly
============================================

Target properties:

- :cmake:prop_tgt:`CXX_STANDARD`
    - inits with variable :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`
- :cmake:prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD`
    - inits with variable :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_C_STANDARD`
- :cmake:prop_tgt:`CUDA_STANDARD`
    - init with variable :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD`


.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Setting standard for target
    :name: code_15_1_listing_0

    # target properties

    set_property(TARGET c_tgt
        PROPERTY
            # C_STANDARD: 90, 99, 11
            C_STANDARD          11
            # C_STANDARD_REQUIRED: On/Off
            # Default: Off
            C_STANDARD_REQUIRED On
            # C_EXTENSIONS: On/Off
            # Default: On
            C_EXTENSIONS        Off
    )

    set_property(TARGET cxx_tgt
        PROPERTY
            # CXX_STANDARD: 98, 11, 14, 17, 20
            CXX_STANDARD 11
            # CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED: On/Off
            # Default: Off
            CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED On
            # CXX_EXTENSIONS: On/Off
            # Default: On
            CXX_EXTENSIONS        Off
    )

- :inline_cmake:`<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED` is :inline_cmake:`Off` dy default
- :inline_cmake:`<LANG>_EXTENSIONS` may be ignored if
  :inline_cmake:`<LANG>_STANDARD` is not set
- :inline_cmake:`<LANG>_STANDARD` specifies a minimum standard, not necessarily
  an exact requirement (higher version may be chosen)
- Properties cannot be :inline_cmake:`INTERFACE`

.. important::
    Projects should set all three properties/variables rather than just some of them

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Setting standard for all the targets
    :name: code_15_1_listing_1

    # Require C++11 and disable extensions for all targets
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD          11)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED On)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS        Off)


15.2. Setting The Language Standard By Feature Requirements
===========================================================

:cmake:manual:`cmake-compile-features.7`

- :cmake:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_FEATURES`
- :cmake:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES`
- :cmake:command:`target_compile_features`
- Each feature must be one of the features supported by the underlying compiler
    - :cmake:prop_gbl:`CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES`
    - :cmake:prop_gbl:`CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES`
    - :cmake:prop_gbl:`CMAKE_CUDA_KNOWN_FEATURES`
    - :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES`
    - :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES`
    - :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILE_FEATURES`
- meta-features: :inline_cmake:`<lang>_std_<value>`
    - :inline_cmake:`cxx_std_98`
    - :inline_cmake:`cxx_std_11`
    - :inline_cmake:`cxx_std_14`
    - :inline_cmake:`cxx_std_17`
    - :inline_cmake:`cxx_std_20`
    - :inline_cmake:`c_std_90`
    - :inline_cmake:`c_std_99`
    - :inline_cmake:`c_std_11`
- In situations where a target has both its :inline_cmake:`<LANG>_STANDARD`
  property set and compile features specified, CMake will enforce the stronger
  standard requirement.

15.2.1. Detection And Use Of Optional Language Features
-------------------------------------------------------

- :cmake:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions.7` -
  :inline_cmake:`$<COMPILE_FEATURES:features>`

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Provide override keyword support for library
    :name: code_15_2_1_listing_0

    add_library(foo ...)
    # Make override a feature requirement only if available
    target_compile_features(foo
        PUBLIC
            $<$<COMPILE_FEATURES:cxx_override>:cxx_override>
    )

    # Define the foo_OVERRIDE symbol so it provides the
    # override keyword if available or empty otherwise
    target_compile_definitions(foo
        PUBLIC
            $<$<COMPILE_FEATURES:cxx_override>:-Dfoo_OVERRIDE=override>
            $<$<NOT:$<COMPILE_FEATURES:cxx_override>>:-Dfoo_OVERRIDE>
    )

.. code-block:: c++
    :linenos:
    :caption: Usage example
    :name: code_15_2_1_listing_1

    class MyClass : public Base
    {
    public:
        void func() foo_OVERRIDE;
    };

- :cmake:module:`WriteCompilerDetectionHeader`
    - :inline_cmake:`write_compiler_detection_header()`

15.3. Recommended Practices
===========================

- Do not set compiler and linker flags directly
- Set standard
    - for overall project with variables
        - :inline_cmake:`CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD`
        - :inline_cmake:`CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED`
        - :inline_cmake:`CMAKE_<LANG>_EXTENSIONS`
            - set them after the first :cmake:command:`project`
            - set them all together
            - omitting :inline_cmake:`CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED` or
              :inline_cmake:`CMAKE_<LANG>_EXTENSIONS` can often lead to
              unexpected behavior
    - for specific target with properties:
        - :inline_cmake:`<LANG>_STANDARD`
        - :inline_cmake:`<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED`
        - :inline_cmake:`<LANG>_EXTENSIONS`
    - for specific target with compile features
        - :inline_cmake:`<lang>_std_<value>`
- Compile features should be used only in special cases where user knows what
  they do

- :cmake:module:`WriteCompilerDetectionHeader` can be used to detect and
  provide implementation for compile features

    - better to use in cases when moving to new standard

16. Target Types
****************

16.1. Executables
=================

:cmake:command:`add_executable`

.. code-block:: cmake
    :linenos:
    :caption: Three forms of ``add_executable()`` command
    :name: code_16_1_listing_0

    add_executable(targetName
        [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
        source1 [source2 ...]
    )
    add_executable(targetName IMPORTED [GLOBAL])
    add_executable(aliasName ALIAS targetName)

:inline_cmake:`IMPORTED` form

- create a CMake target for an existing executable
- cannot be installed
- properties to be set:
    - :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION`
    - :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_\<CONFIG\>`
- :inline_cmake:`GLOBAL` makes the target visible everywhere
- regular executable targets built by the project are always global

:inline_cmake:`ALIAS` form

- creates another name for a specific target
- does not create new build target
- cannot point to alias
- cannot point to imported non-global targets
- cannot be installed
- cannot be exported
- cannot be used as the operand of :cmake:command:`set_property`,
  :cmake:command:`set_target_properties`,
  :cmake:command:`target_link_libraries` etc.

16.2. Libraries
===============

:cmake:command:`add_library`

.. code-block:: cmake
    :linenos:
    :caption: Expanded basic form ``add_library()`` command
    :name: code_16_2_listing_0

    add_library(targetName [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE | OBJECT]
        [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
        source1 [source2 ...]
    )

OBJECT
------

- :cmake:release:`3.12 <`
    - cannot be linked
        - no use with :cmake:command:`target_link_libraries`
        - donâ€™t provide transitive dependencies to the targets they are added
          to as objects/sources
        - header search paths, compiler defines, etc. have to be manually
          carried across
    - should be used as a source of other target
        -  generator expression :inline_cmake:`$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objLib>`
- :cmake:release:`3.12 >`
    - can be used with :cmake:command:`target_link_libraries`
        - as a target to link with
        - as a target that links with some other targets
    - usage requirements propagates
    - object files added only to direct target (no propagation)

IMPORTED
--------

- used by config files
- used by Find-* modules
- don't define a library to be built
- provides a reference for external library
- if library type is defined - should be provided, otherwise
  :inline_cmake:`UNKNOWN` type used
- properties have to be set:
    - non :inline_cmake:`OBJECT` libraries:
        - :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION`
        - :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_\<CONFIG\>`
        - Windows: :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_IMPLIB`
        - Windows: :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_IMPLIB_\<CONFIG\>`
    - :inline_cmake:`OBJECT` libraries:
        - :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_OBJECTS`
        - :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_OBJECTS_\<CONFIG\>`
- other :inline_cmake:`IMPORTED_` properties CMake set's automatically
- defines as a directory scope target
- :inline_cmake:`GLOBAL` makes target scope global
- can be declared without :inline_cmake:`GLOBAL` and then promoted to global
  scope


.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Windows-specific example of imported library
    :name: code_16_2_listing_1

    add_library(myWindowsLib SHARED IMPORTED)
    set_target_properties(myWindowsLib PROPERTIES
        IMPORTED_LOCATION /some/path/bin/foo.dll
        IMPORTED_IMPLIB   /some/path/lib/foo.lib
    )

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Imported library of unknown type
    :name: code_16_2_listing_2

    # Assume FOO_LIB holds the location of the library but its type is unknown
    add_library(mysteryLib UNKNOWN IMPORTED)
    set_target_properties(mysteryLib PROPERTIES
        IMPORTED_LOCATION ${FOO_LIB}
    )

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Imported object library, Windows example
    :name: code_16_2_listing_3

    add_library(myObjLib OBJECT IMPORTED)
    set_target_properties(myObjLib PROPERTIES
    IMPORTED_OBJECTS /some/path/obj1.obj    # These .obj files would be .o
                     /some/path/obj2.obj    # on most other platforms
    )

    # Regular executable target using imported object library.
    # Platform differences are already handled by myObjLib.
    add_executable(myExe $<TARGET_SOURCES:myObjLib>)

INTERFACE
---------

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: Interface library form
    :name: code_16_2_listing_4

    add_library(targetName INTERFACE [IMPORTED [GLOBAL]])

- do not represent a physical library
- serves to collect usage requirements and dependencies
- :inline_cmake:`target_*()` commands can be used with
  :inline_cmake:`INTERFACE` mode to define usage requirements
- :cmake:command:`set_property` and :cmake:command:`set_target_properties`
  can be utilized to set :inline_cmake:`INTERFACE_*` properties
- examples
    - header-only libraries
    - combination a set of libraries in a one meta target

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Header-only library usage
    :name: code_16_2_listing_5

    add_library(myHeaderOnlyToolkit INTERFACE)
    target_include_directories(myHeaderOnlyToolkit
        INTERFACE /some/path/include
    )

    target_compile_definitions(myHeaderOnlyToolkit
        INTERFACE COOL_FEATURE=1
                  $<$<COMPILE_FEATURES:cxx_std_11>:HAVE_CXX11>
    )

    add_executable(myApp ...)
    target_link_libraries(myApp PRIVATE myHeaderOnlyToolkit)

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Convenience interface library
    :name: code_16_2_listing_6

    # Regular library targets
    add_library(algo_fast ...)
    add_library(algo_accurate ...)
    add_library(algo_beta ...)

    # Convenience interface library
    add_library(algo_all INTERFACE)
    target_link_libraries(algo_all
        INTERFACE
            algo_fast
            algo_accurate
            $<$<BOOL:${ENABLE_ALGO_BETA}>:algo_beta>
    )

    # Other targets link to the interface library
    # instead of each of the real libraries
    add_executable(myApp ...)
    target_link_libraries(myApp PRIVATE algo_all)

INTERFACE IMPORTED
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- INTERFACE library is exported or installed for use outside of the project
- directory scope
- prohibited to set :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION`

ALIAS
-----

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: Alias library
    :name: code_16_2_listing_7

    add_library(aliasName ALIAS otherTarget)

- read-only way to refer to another library
- does not create build target
- cannot be installed
- cannot be defined as an alias for another alias
- :cmake:release:`3.11 <` cannot be created for imported targets
- :cmake:release:`3.11 >` could be created for imported global targets
- used to create qualified library name with namespace

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Namespace for the target
    :name: code_16_2_listing_8

    # Any sort of real library (SHARED, STATIC, MODULE
    # or possibly OBJECT)
    add_library(myRealThings SHARED src1.cpp ...)
    add_library(otherThings STATIC srcA.cpp ...)

    # Aliases to the above with special names
    add_library(BagOfBeans::myRealThings ALIAS myRealThings)
    add_library(BagOfBeans::otherThings ALIAS otherThings)

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Using namespaced name from a package
    :name: code_16_2_listing_9

    # Pull in imported targets from an installed package.
    find_package(BagOfBeans REQUIRED)

    # Define an executable that links to the imported
    # library from the installed package
    add_executable(eatLunch main.cpp ...)
    target_link_libraries(eatLunch
        PRIVATE
            BagOfBeans::myRealThings
    )

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Using namespaced name directly from package's project
    :name: code_16_2_listing_10

    # Add BagOfBeans directly to this project, making
    # all of its targets directly available
    add_subdirectory(BagOfBeans)

    # Same definition of linking relationship still works
    add_executable(eatLunch main.cpp ...)
    target_link_libraries(eatLunch
        PRIVATE
            BagOfBeans::myRealThings
    )

.. important::
    Another important aspect of names having a double-colon (::) is that CMake
    will always treat them as the name of an alias or imported target.
    Any attempt to use such a name for a different target type will result in an error.


.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Typos in bare name and in namespaced name
    :name: code_16_2_listing_11

    add_executable(main main.cpp)
    add_library(bar STATIC ...)
    add_library(foo::bar ALIAS bar)

    # Typo in name being linked to, CMake will assume a
    # library called "bart" will be provided by the
    # system at link time and won't issue an error.
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE bart)

    # Typo in name being linked to, CMake flags an error
    # at generation time because a namespaced name must
    # be a CMake target.
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE foo::bart)


16.3. Promoting Imported Targets
================================

- Can be made ``GLOBAL`` when created
- Client code may have no control on creation
- :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_GLOBAL` can be used
- no way back to cancel global visibility
- promotion possible in the same visibility scope as creation
    - :cmake:command:`include` and :cmake:command:`find_package` doesn't
      introduce new directory scope
- may be aliased

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Imported target global scope promotion
    :name: code_16_3_listing_0

    # Imported library created with local visibility.
    # This could be in an external file brought in
    # by an include() call rather than in the same
    # file as the lines further below.
    add_library(builtElsewhere STATIC IMPORTED)
    set_target_properties(builtElsewhere PROPERTIES
        IMPORTED_LOCATION /path/to/libSomething.a
    )

    # Promote the imported target to global visibility
    set_target_properties(builtElsewhere PROPERTIES
        IMPORTED_GLOBAL TRUE
    )

16.4. Recommended Practices
===========================

- :cmake:release:`3.0` each target carries all the necessary information in
  its own properties
- interface libraries
    - header only libraries
    - collection of resources
- imported targets
    - Find modules
    - config files

Imported targets

- :cmake:release:`3.0 <` CMake modules provides set of variables
- :cmake:release:`3.0 >` CMake modules provides imported targets
    - external tools
    - external libraries
    - usage requirements handled by CMake
    - abstracting platform differences
    - abstracting option-dependent tool selection


- static libraries vs object libraries
    - :cmake:release:`3.12 <` Object libraries: no linking possible
    - Object libraries: non trivial propagation of properties
    - Static libraries: better support from old versions

- Aliasing targets with namespace for non project private targets
    - allows to use such target in same source tree
    - allows to use it as imported ones
    - allows renaming original library and stay compatible with consuming
      projects
    - allows to split library and use interface and alias

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: Old version of library
    :name: code_16_4_listing_0

    add_library(deepCompute SHARED ...)

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Splitting the library
    :name: code_16_4_listing_1

    # Now the library has been split in two, so define
    # an interface library with the old name to effectively
    # forward on the link dependency to the new libraries
    add_library(computeAlgoA SHARED ...)
    add_library(computeAlgoB SHARED ...)
    add_library(deepCompute INTERFACE)
    target_link_libraries(deepCompute
        INTERFACE
            computeAlgoA
            computeAlgoB
    )

****************
17. Custom Tasks
****************

17.1. Custom Targets
====================

- :cmake:command:`add_custom_target`
- target always considered out of date -> always rerun
- anything that depends on custom target will be always rerun
- keyword :cmake:inline:keyword:`COMMAND` can be omitted for the first command

.. admonition:: Recommended

    use keyword :cmake:inline:keyword:`COMMAND` for each command

- any target name of executable type will be replaced to the location of
  executable

    - for other target type use generator expression
      :inline_cmake:`$<TARGET_FILE:target_name>`

- executable target used as a command will be added to dependencies of custom
  target

    - same for generator expression or arguments of a command

- dependencies on any other target should be added with
  :cmake:command:`add_dependencies`
- dependencies on any file should be added with :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS`
  keyword

    - useful if a file is generated before
        - target that produces this file will be added to dependencies
    - use only full paths
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS` keyword should not be use for adding
      dependencies on targets
- only order of commands is forced
    - any other assumptions can't be made
        - each command could run in one shell
        - each command could run in its own shell
        - each command could run without shell environment at all
- symbols escaping in commands should be done with
  :cmake:inline:keyword:`VERBATIM` option

    - no further escaping by the platform
- working directory by default is :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`
    - can be changed with :cmake:inline:keyword:`WORKING_DIRECTORY` option
        - relative path is treated relative to
          :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`BYPRODUCTS` lists all files which will be produced by
  this target

    - for :cmake:generator:`Ninja` required if another target depends on
      produced files
    - for all generators files listed in :cmake:inline:keyword:`BYPRODUCTS`
      will have :cmake:prop_sf:`GENERATED` set to
      :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`True`

        - ensure correctly handling of dependent targets on these files
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`COMMENT` option provides way to print a message before
  target will be executed
- :cmake:release:`3.2 >` :cmake:inline:keyword:`USES_TERMINAL` instructs CMake
  to give the command direct access to the terminal, if possible
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`SOURCES` allows to list files that target requires for
  some reasons

    - all of them will be checked if exists
    - used with IDE type generators to show those files in IDE

17.2. Adding Build Steps To An Existing Target
==============================================

- :cmake:command:`add_custom_command` with :cmake:inline:keyword:`TARGET`
  keyword
- attaches the commands to an existing target
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`PRE_BUILD`
    - :cmake:generator:`Visual Studio 7` and above
        - commands should be run before any other rules for the specified
          target
    - all other generators treat as a :cmake:inline:keyword:`PRE_LINK` stage
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`PRE_LINK`
    - The commands will be run after sources are compiled, but before they are
      linked
    - Static libraries: before archive tool run
    - Custom targets: not supported
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`POST_BUILD`
    - commands will be run after all other rules for the specified target

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Multiple command calls
    :name: code_17_2_listing_0

    add_executable(myExe main.cpp)
    add_custom_command(TARGET myExe POST_BUILD
        COMMAND script1 $<TARGET_FILE:myExe>
    )

    # Additional command which will run after the above from a different directory
    add_custom_command(TARGET myExe POST_BUILD
        COMMAND             writeHash $<TARGET_FILE:myExe>
        BYPRODUCTS          ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/verify/myExe.md5
        WORKING_DIRECTORY   ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/verify
    )

17.3. Commands That Generate Files
==================================

- :cmake:command:`add_custom_command` with :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT`
  keyword
- commands treated as a recipe for generating output files
- relative paths are relative to the current binary directory
- no files will be built bu itself
    - must be a target which:
        - in the same directory scope
        - depends on some of the files that :cmake:command:`add_custom_command`
          generates
        - CMake will create a dependency automatically

    )

:ref:`code_17_3_listing_0`: no hashing happen until
:cmake:inline:target:`computeHash` target wouldn't be called explicitly

Source file generation
----------------------

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Generate sources
    :name: code_17_3_listing_1

    add_executable(generator generator.cpp)

    add_custom_command(OUTPUT onTheFly.cpp
        COMMAND generator
    )

    add_executable(myExe ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/onTheFly.cpp)

- :cmake:inline:target:`myExe` target requires :code:`onTheFly.cpp` file
- CMake recognizes that this file is generated by custom command
- custom command uses executable :code:`generator` which is a target itself
- CMake replaces name of the target :cmake:inline:target:`generator` with a
  binary it produces
- custom command depends on the :code:`generator` binary
- CMake knows how to create that binary with a target
- CMake created dependency on the target :cmake:inline:target:`generator`

Possible limitations for such kind of dependency:

1. :code:`onTheFly.cpp` doesn't exist
2. build target :cmake:inline:target:`myExe`
    - target :cmake:inline:target:`generator` brought up to date
    - custom command executed -> :code:`onTheFly.cpp` generated
    - target :cmake:inline:target:`myExe` is built
3. modify file :code:`generator.cpp`
4. build target :cmake:inline:target:`myExe`
    - :code:`generator.cpp` changed
        - target :cmake:inline:target:`generator` brought up to date
    - :code:`onTheFly.cpp` exists
        - custom command **NOT** executed
    - :code:`onTheFly.cpp` exists up to date
        - :cmake:inline:target:`myExe` is **NOT** rebuilt

To avoid this situation an explicit dependency has to be specified with keyword
:cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS`

DEPENDS
^^^^^^^

- can be files or targets
- files that are required by a custom command but haven't appear in arguments
  should also be listed in :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS` argument

.. admonition:: Recommended

    list all targets and files in :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS` argument

MAIN_DEPENDENCY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- mostly the same effect as :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS`
- IDE generators mey apply some additional logic
- custom command becomes replacement for the default build rule

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: replace default build rule for file
    :name: code_17_3_listing_2

    add_custom_command(OUTPUT transformed.cpp
        COMMAND transform
                ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/original.cpp
                transformed.cpp
        MAIN_DEPENDENCY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/original.cpp
    )

    add_executable(original    original.cpp)
    add_executable(transformed transformed.cpp)

- no shared objects will be created for target :cmake:inline:target:`original`
    - default rule for :code:`original.cpp` replaced by custom command
        - :code:`transformed.cpp` will be generated instead object file
- linker error for target :cmake:inline:target:`original`

can be solved using keyword :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS` instead of
:cmake:inline:keyword:`MAIN_DEPENDENCY`

IMPLICIT_DEPENDS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- supported only by Makefile generators
    - due to limit number of supported generators should be avoided
- invokes a C or C++ scanner to determine dependencies of the listed files
- discovered dependencies added to the custom command dependency list

DEPFILE
^^^^^^^

- supported only by :cmake:generator:`Ninja`
    - due to limit number of supported generators should be avoided
    - emit error for any other generator
- provides a Ninja-specific :code:`.d` dependency file

APPEND
^^^^^^

- with :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT` form
    - the first :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT` file listed must be the same
      for the first and subsequent calls to :cmake:command:`add_custom_command`
    - only :cmake:inline:keyword:`COMMAND` and :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS`
      can be used for the subsequent calls
- with :cmake:inline:keyword:`TARGET` form
    - no :cmake:inline:keyword:`APPEND` keyword required for subsequent calls
      for the same target
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`COMMENT` and
      :cmake:inline:keyword:`WORKING_DIRECTORY` can be used for subsequent
      calls

17.4. Configure Time Tasks
==========================

On configure time custom task mey be required:

- obtain information to be used during configuration
- writing or touching files which need to be updated any time CMake is re-run
- generation of :code:`CMakeLists.txt` or other files which need to be included
  or processed as part of the current configure step

----------

- :cmake:command:`execute_process`
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`COMMAND` section specifies tasks
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`WORKING_DIRECTORY` specifies where those task will run
- no intermediate shell environment
    - no io redirection
    - environment variables not supported
- for multiple :cmake:inline:keyword:`COMMAND` sections
    - executed in order listed
    - output from previous command piped to input of the next one
    - output of the *last* command is sent to the output of CMake
    - error of *each* command is sent to the error stream of CMake
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT_VARIABLE` captures the output of the last
  command to variable
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`ERROR_VARIABLE` captures the error stream of each
  command
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE` removes trailing
  whitespaces from output variable

.. admonition:: Recommended

    use :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE` always if you
    use :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT_VARIABLE`

- :cmake:inline:keyword:`ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE` removes trailing
  whitespaces from error variable

.. admonition:: Recommended

    use :cmake:inline:keyword:`ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE` always if you
    use :cmake:inline:keyword:`ERROR_VARIABLE`

- using same variable name for the error and output will lead to merge  these
  two streams
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT_FILE` allows to redirect output of the last
  command to a file

    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE` has no effect on
      file
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`ERROR_FILE` allows to redirect errors of each command
  to a file

     - :cmake:inline:keyword:`ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE` has no effect on
       file
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`INPUT_FILE` can be used to provide file with input to
  the first command
- same stream cannot be captured to the file and to a variable
    - possible to send one stream to a variable and another to the file
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT_QUIET` to discard output of the last command
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`ERROR_QUIET` to discard error stream of all commands
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`RESULT_VARIABLE` to check the return code or error
  string message of the last command being run

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: checking for the success of a call to :cmake:inline:command:`execute_process()`
    :name: code_17_4_listing_0

        RESULT_VARIABLE result
    )

    if(result)
        message(FATAL_ERROR "runSomeScript failed: ${result}")
    endif()


- :cmake:release:`3.10 >` :cmake:inline:keyword:`RESULTS_VARIABLE` stores the
  result of each command in a list

- :cmake:inline:keyword:`TIMEOUT` leads to termination with timeout error for
  the sequence of commands if they take time longer then was set in option

    - CMake will not halt with error
    - Timeout error will be stored in :cmake:inline:keyword:`RESULT_VARIABLE`

- if project enables C and C++ languages in first run all commands in
  :cmake:command:`execute_process` will have :cmake:variable:env:`CC` and
  :cmake:variable:env:`CXX` environment variables explicitly set to C and C++
  compilers of the main build

    - in subsequent runs of CMake these variables will not be set
    - commands should not use environment variables :cmake:variable:env:`CC`
      and :cmake:variable:env:`CXX`
    - to not set environment variables to the value of main build compilers in
      a first run :cmake:inline:variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_NO_COMPILER_ENV` can
      be set to :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`True`. (undocumented variable)

    endif()

    # Platform independent equivalent
    add_custom_target(myCleanup
        COMMAND "${CMAKE_COMMAND}" -E remove_directory "${discardDir}"
    )

.. warning::
    :cmake:inline:command:`if-else` testing **target** platform not **host**

- :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_COMMAND` holds the full path to ``cmake`` executable
    - same ``cmake`` version for all the custom commands
    - same that was invoked for the main build
    - remains the same for the generation step

- :cmake:inline:keyword:`COMMENT` in :cmake:command:`add_custom_target` and
  :cmake:command:`add_custom_command` not always reliable

    - command line tool ``-E echo`` can be used instead


.. code-block:: cmake_code

:cmake:manual:`cmake.1 run-a-script`

.. code-block:: Bash
    :caption: Script mode
    :name: code_17_5_listing_3

    cmake [options] -P filename

- no configure or generate steps
- ``CMakeCache.txt`` not updated
- script file is essentially processed as just a set of commands rather than as
  a project

    - no project related commands supported

- supports ``-D`` option to pass variables and their values

.. code-block:: Bash

17.7. Recommended Practices
===========================

- for custom tasks prefer to use build time commands
  :cmake:command:`add_custom_command` and :cmake:command:`add_custom_target`
  instead of configure time command :cmake:command:`execute_process`

    - keep configure time as short as possible
        - configure step maybe reinvoked any time due to changes to files

- use CMake's command line tool mode :inline_cmake:`-E <cmd>`
  everywhere possible instead of platform specific commands

- use CMake's scripting mode :inline_cmake:`-P <filename>`
  instead of any other scripting platform dependent languages

    - reduce complexity of a project
    - less dependencies
    - platform independence

- try to avoid for :cmake:command:`add_custom_command`
  :cmake:command:`add_custom_target`

    - better to use :inline_cmake:`${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "message"` instead
      of :cmake:inline:keyword:`COMMENT`
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`PRE_BUILD`
    - generator specific :cmake:inline:keyword:`IMPLICIT_DEPENDS`
      :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPFILE`
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`MAIN_DEPENDENCY` when it is not an intention to
      replace default build rule

- all files created by :cmake:command:`add_custom_command` should be listed in
  :cmake:inline:keyword:`OUTPUT`

- explicitly list all the required files in :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS`

- use absolute paths in :cmake:inline:keyword:`DEPENDS`

- test the result of :cmake:command:`execute_process` with :cmake:command:`if`
  and :cmake:inline:keyword:`RESULT_VARIABLE`

**********************
18. Working With Files
**********************

- constructing paths or extracting components of a path
- obtaining a list of files from a directory
- copying files
- generating a file from string contents
- generating a file from another fileâ€™s contents
- reading in the contents of a file
- computing a checksum or hash of a file

18.1. Manipulating Paths
========================

:cmake:command:`get_filename_component`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: Extraction of the different parts of a path or file name
    :name: code_18_1_listing_0

    get_filename_component(outVar input component [CACHE])


Where ``component`` is

:cmake:inline:keyword:`DIRECTORY`

- extract the path without filename
- :cmake:release:`2.8.12 <` was called :cmake:inline:keyword:`PATH`
    - synonym for :cmake:inline:keyword:`DIRECTORY` for backward compatibility

:cmake:inline:keyword:`NAME`
  name with extension

:cmake:inline:keyword:`NAME_WE`
  name without extension

:cmake:inline:keyword:`EXT`
  extension from the first ``.`` symbol in name

:cmake:inline:keyword:`CACHE`
    optional, stores result in a cache variable

.. warning::

    Do not use :cmake:inline:keyword:`CACHE` if you are not sure you really
    need it

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Extracting filename components example
    :name: code_18_1_listing_1

    set(input /some/path/foo.bar.txt)
    get_filename_component(path1     ${input} DIRECTORY) # /some/path
    get_filename_component(path2     ${input} PATH)      # /some/path
    get_filename_component(fullName  ${input} NAME)      # foo.bar.txt
    get_filename_component(baseName  ${input} NAME_WE)   # foo
    get_filename_component(extension ${input} EXT)       # .bar.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: Obtaining the absolute path
    :name: code_18_1_listing_2

    get_filename_component(outVar input component [BASE_DIR dir] [CACHE])

- input can be absolute or relative path
- if path is relative and
    - if :cmake:inline:keyword:`BASE_DIR` given input considered to be relative
      to given base directory
    - otherwise input considered to be relative to the current source directory
      (:cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`)
- if path is absolute and :cmake:inline:keyword:`BASE_DIR` is given - it will
  be ignored
- component :cmake:inline:keyword:`ABSOLUTE` computes absolute path without
  resolving of symbolic links
- component :cmake:inline:keyword:`REALPATH` computes absolute path with
  resolving of symbolic links

:cmake:command:`file(RELATIVE_PATH)` provides inverse operation

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: Obtaining the relative path command signature
    :name: code_18_1_listing_3

    file(RELATIVE_PATH outVar relativeToDir input)

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: Obtaining the relative path example
    :name: code_18_1_listing_4

    set(basePath /base)
    set(fooBarPath /base/foo/bar)
    set(otherPath /other/place)

    file(RELATIVE_PATH fooBar ${basePath} ${fooBarPath})
    file(RELATIVE_PATH other ${basePath} ${otherPath})

    # The variables now have the following values:
    # fooBar = foo/bar
    # other = ../other/place

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: Extracting parts of a full command line
    :name: code_18_1_listing_5

    get_filename_component(progVar input
        PROGRAM
        [PROGRAM_ARGS argVar]
        [CACHE]
    )

- ``input`` is treated as a command line which may contains arguments
- full path to the executable will be extracted and stored into
  :cmake:inline:variable:`progVar` variable

    - :envvar:`PATH` may be taken into the account

- if :cmake:inline:keyword:`PROGRAM_ARGS` arguments will be stored into
  :cmake:inline:variable:`argVar` variable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :cmake:command:`file(TO_NATIVE_PATH)` converts path to host platform's native
  path
- :cmake:command:`file(TO_CMAKE_PATH)` converts path to CMake's path

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: List of paths transformation
    :name: code_18_1_listing_6

    # Unix example
    set(customPath /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin)

    file(TO_CMAKE_PATH ${customPath} outVar)
    # outVar = /usr/local/bin;/usr/bin;/bin


18.2. Copying Files
===================

configure_file()
----------------

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: configure_file() reduced command signature
    :name: code_18_2_listing_0

    configure_file(source destination [COPYONLY | @ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES])

- :cmake:command:`configure_file`
- copying in configure time
- only one file per command
- :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`source` must be name of existing file
    - full or relative path
        - relative path considered to be relative to
          :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`
        - use relative path instead of using
          :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` as a part of the paths
- :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`destination` must be a file name
    - full or relative path
        - relative path considered to be relative to
          :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`
        - use relative path instead of using
          :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` as a part of the paths
    - any missing parts of a destination path will be created by CMake
- if :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`source` is modified
    - :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`destination` considered to be out of date
    - configuration step will be re-run
    - :cmake:command:`configure_file` should be used for files that may be
      changed rarely to not force configure step to run

CMake Variable substitution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- if :cmake:inline:keyword:`COPYONLY` or :cmake:inline:keyword:`@COPY` not used
    - will be replaced by its value
        - everything that looks like CMake variable
          (:inline_cmake:`${var_name}`)

            - if no variable exists with provided name empty string will be
              substituted
        - strings of the form :inline_cmake:`@someVar@`

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: Variable substitution ``CMakeLists.txt``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_1

    set(FOO "String with spaces")
    configure_file(various.txt.in various.txt)

.. code-block::
    :caption: Variable substitution ``various.txt.in``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_2

    CMake version: ${CMAKE_VERSION}
    Substitution works inside quotes too: "${FOO}"
    No substitution without the $ and {}: FOO
    Empty ${} specifier gets removed
    Escaping has no effect: \${FOO}
    @-syntax also supported: @FOO@

.. code-block::
    :caption: Variable substitution ``various.txt``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_3

    CMake version: 3.7.0
    Substitution works inside quotes too: "String with spaces"
    No substitution without the $ and {}: FOO
    Empty specifier gets removed
    Escaping has no effect: \String with spaces
    @-syntax also supported: String with spaces

:cmake:inline:keyword:`ESCAPE_QUOTES` keyword cause any substituted quotes to
be preceded with a ``\``

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: Variable substitution ESCAPE_QUOTES ``CMakeLists.txt``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_4

    set(BAR "Some \"quoted\" value")
    configure_file(quoting.txt.in quoting.txt)
    configure_file(quoting.txt.in quoting_escaped.txt ESCAPE_QUOTES)

.. code-block::
    :caption: Variable substitution ESCAPE_QUOTES ``quoting.txt.in``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_5

    A: @BAR@
    B: "@BAR@"

.. code-block::
    :caption: Variable substitution ESCAPE_QUOTES ``quoting.txt``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_6

    A: Some "quoted" value
    B: "Some "quoted" value"

.. code-block::
    :caption: Variable substitution ESCAPE_QUOTES ``quoting_escaped.txt``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_7

    A: Some \"quoted\" value
    B: "Some \"quoted\" value"

:cmake:inline:keyword:`@ONLY`
    To limit substitution only to syntax :inline_cmake:`@someVar@` and to left
    :cmake:inline:variable:`${someVar}` unchanged

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: Variable substitution @ONLY ``CMakeLists.txt``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_8

    set(USER_FILE whoami.txt)
    configure_file(whoami.sh.in whoami.sh @ONLY)

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Variable substitution @ONLY ``whoami.sh.in``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_9

    #!/bin/sh

    echo ${USER} > "@USER_FILE@"

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Variable substitution @ONLY ``whoami.sh``
    :name: code_18_2_listing_10

    #!/bin/sh

    echo ${USER} > "whoami.txt"

:cmake:inline:keyword:`NOCOPY`
    to disable substitution 

.. important::
    Variables that represent paths or filenames should be surrounded with a
    quotes to handle cases with spaces in name

Same functionality as with :cmake:command:`configure_file` also supported for
strings using command :cmake:command:`string(configure)`

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: string(CONFIGURE) command prototype
    :name: code_18_2_listing_11

    string(CONFIGURE input outVar [@ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES])

file(COPY|INSTALL)
------------------

- :cmake:command:`file(COPY)`
- :cmake:command:`file(INSTALL)`

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: file(COPY|INSTALL) command prototype
    :name: code_18_2_listing_12

- both commands support same set of options
- using when no substitution is required
- multiple source files supported
- directory hierarchy supported
- possible to preserve  symlinks
- non absolute source file or directory path considered relative to
  :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`
- non absolute destination directory path considered relative to
  :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`
- destination directory structure is created as necessary
- if source is directory it will be copied to destination
    - to copy directory content ``/``  should be appended to the source
      directory path

    file(COPY base/srcDir DESTINATION destDir)  # --> destDir/srcDir
    file(COPY base/srcDir/ DESTINATION destDir) # --> destDir

- :cmake:inline:keyword:`COPY` form keeps the destination files and folders
  permissions the same

- :cmake:inline:keyword:`INSTALL` form discard destination files and folders
  permissions

:cmake:inline:keyword:`NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS`
    forces to discard original permissions

:cmake:inline:keyword:`USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS`
    forces to keep original permissions

:cmake:inline:keyword:`FILE_PERMISSIONS`
    allows to customize permissions for files

:cmake:inline:keyword:`DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`
    allows to customize permissions for directories

.. list-table:: Permissions for files and directories
    :name: table_18_2_n_1

    * - :cmake:inline:keyword:`OWNER_READ`

      - :cmake:inline:keyword:`WORLD_EXECUTE`
    * - :cmake:inline:keyword:`SETUID`
      - :cmake:inline:keyword:`SETGID`
      -

- multiple permissions allowed
- that ones which is not understood on a given platform will be skipped

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: Copy file with permissions (shell script)
    :name: code_18_2_listing_14

    file(COPY whoami.sh

                         WORLD_READ WORLD_WRITE
    )

- both forms preserve timestamps
    - copying will be skipped if source with the same timestamp is already
      present at destination

- :cmake:inline:keyword:`INSTALL` prints every file being copied
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`COPY` prints nothing
- can be used to copy files in install time as a part of cmake install script
- both forms provides wildcard and regular expression to match specific files
  which requires additional logic for them

    - limit files that have to be copied
    - exclude files
    - set permissions for only specific ones

- multiple patterns and regular expressions can be given

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: Copy files by patterns and set permissions
    :name: code_18_2_listing_15

    file(COPY someDir
        DESTINATION .

            PATTERN "*.sh"
                PERMISSIONS OWNER_READ OWNER_WRITE OWNER_EXECUTE
    )

In example :ref:`code_18_2_listing_15`

- all private headers will be excluded from copying (``.*_private\\.h``)
- all headers will be copied with original permissions (``*.h``)
- all the scripts will be copied with specified permissions (``*.sh``)

.. code-block:: cmake_code

- if only one source file is provided
    - if no directory named as this file exists
        - :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`destination` is treated as a filename
    - if directory exists source file will be copied into
    - if :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`destination` contains absolute or
      relative path CMake will try to create all the components if it doesn't
      exist
- if not only one source files provided
    - :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`destination` must refer to existing
      directory
    - to ensure that directory and all preceding path components exists use
      command mode :cmake:inline:command:`make_directory` sub-command
- will always copy a file if its even exists in destination path
    - timestamp will be updated
    - content will be updated

.. admonition:: Recommended

18.3. Reading And Writing Files Directly
========================================

Configure time writing
----------------------

- :cmake:command:`file(write)`
- :cmake:command:`file(append)`

- creates a file and all the intermediate path components
- writes a content specified
- no newline will be appended in the end of input
- if file exists
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`WRITE` form will discard the content
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`APPEND` form will add to the end of a file
        - no newline will be added before adding

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: file write and append
    :name: code_18_3_listing_0

    set(msg "Hello world")
    file(WRITE hello.txt ${msg})
    file(APPEND hello.txt " from CMake")

    # contents of hello.txt
    # Hello world from CMake

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: file write with newline
    :name: code_18_3_listing_1

    file(WRITE multi.txt "First line
    Second line
    ")

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: file write with newline brackets way
    :name: code_18_3_listing_2

    file(WRITE multi.txt [[
    First line
    Second line
    ]])

    file(WRITE userCheck.sh [=[
    #!/bin/bash

    [[ -n "${USER}" ]] && echo "Have USER"

    ]=])

.. note::

    first line break after ``[=*[`` ignored

- no substitution of variables with brackets ``[=[ ]=]``
- generator expressions available with brackets ``[=[ ]=]``

Generate time writing
---------------------

- :cmake:command:`file(generate)`

- Allows to write file for each build type supported by current generator
- generate time writing
    - no files written immediately
    - output file cannot be used as input for anything else during
      configuration step

        - could be used as an input for commands working in build phase

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: :cmake:inline:command:`file(GENERATE)` signature
    :name: code_18_3_listing_3

    file(GENERATE
        OUTPUT output-file
        <INPUT input-file|CONTENT content>
        [CONDITION expression]
    )

- one of :cmake:inline:keyword:`INPUT` or :cmake:inline:keyword:`CONTENT`
  must be present
- all the arguments support generator expressions
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`CONDITION` is used to skip some build configurations
    - should evaluates to ``1`` or to ``0``

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :linenos:
    :caption: generating files with customized names and contents
    :name: code_18_3_listing_4

    # Generate unique files for all but Release

        CONDITION $<NOT:$<CONFIG:Release>>
    )

    # Embedded content, bracket syntax does not
    # prevent the use of generator expressions
    file(GENERATE
        OUTPUT ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/details-$<CONFIG>.txt
        CONTENT [[
    Built as "$<CONFIG>" for platform "$<PLATFORM_ID>".
    ]])

- content of the input file will be substituted with evaluated generator
  expressions

- output file can be the same for all the build configurations if its contents
  doesn't depend on build configuration
- multiple command calls disallowed for one output file
- :cmake:release:`3.10 <` relative paths treated relative to the current
  working directory where ``cmake`` was invoked
- :cmake:release:`3.10 >`
    - for input: relative to :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`
    - for output: relative to :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`

Configure time reading
----------------------

- :cmake:command:`file(read)`
- reads the contents of a file and stores it in a variable provided

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: :cmake:inline:command:`file(READ)` signature
    :name: code_18_3_listing_5

    file(READ fileName outVar
        [OFFSET offset] [LIMIT byteCount] [HEX]
    )

:cmake:inline:keyword:`OFFSET`
    read only from specified offset

:cmake:inline:keyword:`LIMIT`
    limits number of bytes to be read

:cmake:inline:keyword:`HEX`
    contents will be converted to hexidecimal representation

- :cmake:command:`file(STRINGS)`
- reads contents of a file in a list of strings

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: :cmake:inline:command:`file(STRINGS)` commonly used options
    :name: code_18_3_listing_6

    file(STRINGS fileName outVar

        [LIMIT_OUTPUT maxStoredBytes]
        [LIMIT_COUNT maxStoredLines]
        [REGEX regex]
    )

:cmake:inline:keyword:`LENGTH_MAXIMUM`
    excludes strings longer than limit

:cmake:inline:keyword:`LENGTH_MINIMUM`
    excludes strings shorter than limit

:cmake:inline:keyword:`LIMIT_INPUT`
    limits total number of bytes read

:cmake:inline:keyword:`LIMIT_OUTPUT`
    limits total number of bytes stored

:cmake:inline:keyword:`LIMIT_COUNT`
    limits total number of lines stored

:cmake:inline:keyword:`REGEX`
    extract only specific lines of interest from a file

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: extract lines from file by regular expression
    :name: code_18_3_listing_7

    file(STRINGS myStory.txt versionLines

    )

    string(REGEX REPLACE "${regex}" "\\1" fooVersion "${fooVersion}")

    # file config.txt contains:
    # FOO_VERSION = 2.3.5

    # fooVersion:
    # 2.3.5

18.4. File System Manipulation
==============================

:cmake:command:`file(RENAME)`
    - rename ``source`` to ``destination``
    - if ``destination`` exists replace it
    - ``source`` and ``destination`` must be both files or directories
    - to move file to a directory ``destination`` should contain file name
      after directory path
    - will not create intermediate directories
    - command mode analogue: :code:`-E rename source destination`

:cmake:command:`file(REMOVE)`
    - to delete files
    - no effect for directories
    - no error if file doesn't exist
    - command mode analogue: :code:`-E remove [-f] files ...`
        - if file doesn't exists
            - ``-f`` option force to have zero return code
            - without ``-f`` non zero code will be returned

:cmake:command:`file(REMOVE_RECURSE)`
    - to delete directories and its contents
    - command mode analogue: :code:`-E remove_directory dir`
        - accepts only directory name
        - accepts only one directory

:cmake:command:`file(MAKE_DIRECTORY)`
    - creates listed directories
    - no error if directory exists
    - will create intermediate directories
    - command mode analogue: :code:`make_directory`

:cmake:command:`file(GLOB)`
    - list content of specific directory

:cmake:command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)`
    - list content of specific directory recursively

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: :cmake:command:`file(GLOB)` signature
    :name: code_18_3_listing_9

    file(GLOB outVar

        expressions...
    )

expressions
    - simplified regular expressions
    - wildcards + character subset selection
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`GLOB_RECURSE` includes path components
    - example patterns
        - :code:`*.txt`
        - :code:`foo?.txt`
        - :code:`bar[0-9].txt`
        - :code:`/images/*.png`

- :cmake:inline:keyword:`GLOB` stores filenames and directory names matched the
  ``expression``
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`GLOB_RECURSE` stores only filenames by default
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`LIST_DIRECTORIES` add directory names to list
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`GLOB_RECURSE` not follow symlinks by default
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`FOLLOW_SYMLINKS` descend into directory
- returns the full paths by default
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`RELATIVE` returns paths relative to the specific
      directory

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: :cmake:command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)` with relative paths reporting
    :name: code_18_3_listing_11

    set(base /usr/share)

    file(GLOB_RECURSE images
        RELATIVE ${base}
        ${base}/*/*.png
    )

.. warning::

    :cmake:inline:keyword:`GLOB...` commands not very fast

.. error::

    :cmake:command:`file(GLOB)` and :cmake:command:`file(GLOB_RECURSE)` often
    used to collect sources and headers for creating targets with
    :cmake:command:`add_executable` or :cmake:command:`add_library`. This
    shouldn't be done in this way because if physical file set on disc is
    changed CMake will not rerun and those changes will never influence the
    build.

    :cmake:release:`3.12 >` :cmake:inline:keyword:`CONFIGURE_DEPENDS` adds
    additional logic which checks the changes. It leads to performance
    penalties and not work for all generators. Should not be used!

    :ref:`section_28_5_1` introduces alternative techniques to collect set of
    sources.

.. _section_18_5:

18.5. Downloading And Uploading
===============================

Presented by two commands :cmake:command:`file(DOWNLOAD)` and
:cmake:command:`file(UPLOAD)`

.. code-block:: cmake

    file(DOWNLOAD url fileName [options...])
    file(UPLOAD fileName url [options...])

- :cmake:inline:keyword:`DOWNLOAD`
    - downloads from ``url`` specified and stores in a ``filename``
    - relative path treated to be relative to current binary directory
- :cmake:inline:keyword:`UPLOAD`
    - uploads specified file to the url provided
    - relative path treated to be relative to current source directory

Common options:

:cmake:inline:keyword:`LOG` ``outVar``
    saves the log of operation

:cmake:inline:keyword:`SHOW_PROGRESS`
    progress information is logged as status messages

.. admonition:: Recommended

    Due to big amount of redundant messages shown recommended to use only to
    debug procedures

:cmake:inline:keyword:`INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` ``seconds``
    terminate the operation after a period of inactivity

:cmake:inline:keyword:`USERPWD` ``username:password``
    :cmake:release:`3.7 >` Authentication details.

.. warning::
    Hard-coding password is a security issue.
    Password should come from outside the project, some properly protected file
    read from users host in configure time

:cmake:inline:keyword:`HTTPHEADER` ``header``
    :cmake:release:`3.7 >` Provides HTTP header. Can be used multiple times

.. code-block:: cmake_code
    :caption: Download file with http header provided
    :name: code_18_3_listing_12

    file(DOWNLOAD "https://somebucket.s3.amazonaws.com/myfile.tar.gz"
        myfile.tar.gz
        EXPECTED_HASH SHA1=${myfileHash}
        HTTPHEADER "Host: somebucket.s3.amazonaws.com"
        HTTPHEADER "Date: ${timestamp}"
        HTTPHEADER "Content-Type: application/x-compressed-tar"
        HTTPHEADER "Authorization: AWS ${s3key}:${signature}"
    )

Additional options for :cmake:inline:keyword:`DOWNLOAD`

:cmake:inline:keyword:`EXPECTED_HASH` ``ALGO=value``
    - specifies checksum to validate against
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`ALGO` on of supported algorithms by CMake
    - :cmake:inline:keyword:`EXPECTED_MD5` is synonym to
      :cmake:inline:keyword:`EXPECTED_HASH` ``MD5=...``

:cmake:inline:keyword:`TLS_VERIFY` :cmake:inline:literal:unquoted:`True|False`
    - indicates if a server certificate should be validated for ``https://``
    - if not provided CMake will check :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY`
        - if also not provided no validation happen

:cmake:inline:keyword:`TLS_CAINFO` ``fileName``
    a custom Certificate Authority file can be specified for ``https://`` urls
